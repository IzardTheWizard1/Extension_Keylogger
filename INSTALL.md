## üì¶ Installation & Deployment

### üîß Local Installation (Sideload)

You can load the Chrome extension manually for development and testing purposes:

1. Open Chrome and navigate to:
   ```
   chrome://extensions/
   ```

2. Enable **Developer Mode** in the top right.

3. Click **‚ÄúLoad unpacked‚Äù** and select the `extension/` directory of this repository.

4. Once loaded, the extension will begin logging keystrokes and storing them via `chrome.storage.local`, with data exfiltration via background beaconing.

üß™ **Pro Tip**: Open the Chrome Developer Tools (Console) to inspect debug logs or use `chrome.storage.local.get` to verify key capture before transmission.
